## Description

This website represents my current skills with HTML (divs, sections, classes, etc) and CSS (flex box).
This employee portfolio has minimal content as it is my first attempt (will be updated and evolved over time) as
I am still catching up with 16 other assignments for this bootcamp at the moment (August 25, 2021). The images
illustrate my main gigs as DJ, to represent who I am and what I love to do, whereas the content in text and in flex boxes below the images are expressing myself as a bootcamp student!

My motivation for this project was to have a simple page to express / represent myself both as a DJ and coding bootcamp student.

I built this project so then I have a page that will allow others who come across the page to be able to get a better glimpse of who I am, what I do/what I've done, and what I plan to do going forward.

The problem that this project solves is me now no longer portfolio-less, I at least have a simple and basic page template to start with to then further elevate into something more.

I learned how to hyperlink images, style cool hover effects, mess with flexbox, and make a nav bar at the top of the page!

thoughts and actions.

## Known Bugs

No bugs! Just messy code to be honest.
