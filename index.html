                I am a 23 year old Asian American who is learning to be a Full-Stack Developer through UW Seattle's Coding Bootcamp.
                I DJ on my free-time. I fell behind on this course because I was overconfident in the beginning and took the meaning of "everything is due by the end of the bootcamp" to the fullest extent.
                I am fully aware of being a huge procrastinator but I can also say that pressure and deadlines are a huge motivator for me. I have continued to learn countless of things about myself
                from participating in this bootcamp; from my strengths to my weaknesses. I learned what I will absolutely need to improve on and apply in my life to be more more successful, also
                a comforting fact is that most people like to work with me due to my cheerful and cooperative attitude. It was lovely to be put in this academic atmosphere with this specific cohort, I would not
                change it for anything in the World.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                I would like to conclude that on Wednesday, August 25, 2021, I still have 15 assignments left to complete on top of getting my final project (#3) done with my group. It may sound like
                a lot and overwhelming, but if I can do this, it will be amazing. I could really say "I DID THAT", of course not proud of the procrastination but proves at least to me that I am willing
            and capable.
